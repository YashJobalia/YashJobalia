<h3>About Me</h3>
<div align="justify">I am a passionate software developer with a Master of Science (MS) in Computer Science from George Mason University. I have a strong background in web development and application development. While my primary interest lies in software development, I have also explored the field of IoT during my coursework, which has sparked an interest in Real Time Embedded Systems. I have completed internships during both my bachelor's and master's programs. During my bachelor's, I interned for 10 months, and during my master's, I interned for 3 months. These experiences have equipped me with practical skills and a deeper understanding of the industry.
